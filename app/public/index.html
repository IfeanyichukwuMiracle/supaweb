        <p class="home-hero-title">Mike Achieved His Goal</p>
        <p class="home-hero-body">
          Mike has an inspiring story (for the sake of confidentiality, we'll
          call him Mike). Mike was like most of use who weren't born into
          riches. He went through the schooling system. He studied a course at
          the university, came out and began looking for a job - he didn't find
          any.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="home-hero-body">
          But Mike became fed up and wanted a change in his life like most
          people but one thing differentiated him from others who also wanted a
          change in their life and it was the fact that
          <strong>he was intentional</strong>, he was taking massive actions to
          bring his dreams to fulfillment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="home-hero-body">
          Mike had always dreamt of owning one of the largest clothing brand in
          Africa, one that could compete with the likes of Louis Vuitton. So he
          learnt skills that could help him accomplish this big goal of his.
          Cutting the long story short, setbacks came, relatives judged and
          criticized but he remained resilient and after 3 years of being
          relentless,
          <strong>
            he didn't see any success. What??? You read right. He didn't see any
            success. Or did he?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="home-hero-body">
          During the 3 years, Mike became another person, he leveled up in
          skills and knowledge and became more knowledgeable about the market he
          was getting into. So being the relentless person he was, he continued
          and this time he knew he was closer to success and eventually he
          achieved success
